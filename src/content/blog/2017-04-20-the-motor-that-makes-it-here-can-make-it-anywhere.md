"The motor that makes it here can make it anywhere."

Such was a 1973 slogan for Evinrude Motors, in an advertising campaign featuring Toledo Bend Lake.  Back then, Toledo Bend was just a half dozen years old and was filled with trees and stumps, making fishing fabulous but navigation a challenge.

"This is Toledo Bend... 80 miles of bass woods and water on the Texas/Louisiana border," the print in the advertisement reads.

"With trees above water, jungles underneath, and stumps in between-- it's no place for weak-sister motors or tackle.

"Evinrude's tough new bass boat motors take it in stride.

"On the long runs, their high speed efficiency cuts miles and gallons down to size.  Firepower electronic ignition keeps things smooth from top speed to trolling.  Tough new motor mountings  add strength where you need it most.  While balanced trim-tab steering and power shift keeps everything under finger-tip control.

"The tougher the going the more Evinrude has going for you." [![Text of advetisement](@assets/images/IMG_4325.jpg)]
