[![image](images/image-24-682x1024.jpeg)](https://allthingssabine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/image-24.jpeg) Every single time I see Toro Bayou (aka Toro Creek), I feel like I am either watching some cinematic production or looking through the pages of a story book.  It is dreamy, it is surreal.  It is a playground for a photographer!

For me, there is just something about Toro that keeps me going back... To take photos, to relax, to think.  Only the mosquitoes taint the beautiful bayou.

Toro Bayou is scenic and remote, winding through dense woods of Southern Sabine Parish and Northern Vernon Parish.  It features white water, rock gardens, and an abundance of sand beaches, good fishing and numerous side streams for exploration.

The water is swift and clean – the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries has graded Toro Bayou one of the best streams in the state for its clear water, natural beauty and wilderness characteristics.
