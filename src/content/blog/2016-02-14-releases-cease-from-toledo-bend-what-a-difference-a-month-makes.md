January 2016- All working gates at the Toledo Bend Dam spillway were open at least one foot each (9 gates), emptying water from Toledo Bend into Bayou Toro and eventually downtstream into the Sabine River.  Water was being released twenty four-seven to cope with flooding on the upper end of the Sabine River which resulted in high levels on Toledo Bend Lake.  All this water being dumped from the lake rushed its way downstream, and was a heck of site to see (not to mention this created a feeding frenzy for seabirds waiting below the spillway for their meals to be delivered from the lake).

February 2016- No spillway gates are open and no water is being released from Toledo Bend downstream, as the lake level has subsided to pretty much normal.  All is quiet on this part of Toro Bayou and the Sabine River now... it is like a whole different place than it was just a month ago!
