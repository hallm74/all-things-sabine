A near drone mishap... though through our pilot's excellent skills, we were able to avoid crash and/or injury to aircraft.

Here, we are flying away from the Toledo Bend Dam spillway... When we took off, the wind was not so bad, but within minutes it kicked up a good bit.  We avoid flying in winds above 14 miles per hour... and we always check weather for wind speed and speed of gusts.  We were not in the danger zone gust-wise, or at least nothing we looked at prior to flying on Sunday indicated otherwise... but.... let's just say this was a tough and nerveracking flight back.
