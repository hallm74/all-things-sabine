Now in its fourth or third or fifth week (something like that), the dismantling of the old U. S. Hwy. 84 bridge crossing the Sabine River continues.

The bridge, built in the 1930s, is being removed to make way for a new bridge.  It connects Logansport, Louisiana and Joaquin, Texas.  This is a massive and super-slow process as you will see from the video footage.  The bridge is literally being removed piece by piece.  It looks like the crew has began removing some of the bridge decking, after having completely removed the sides and sidewalks and everything on the wider side of the bridge piers.
