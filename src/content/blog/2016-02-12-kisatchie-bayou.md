Visitors to the Kisatchie Bayou Recreation Complex in Natchitoches Parish can enjoy scenic views of the rocky bayou surrounded by beautiful old growth hardwood and pine which gives this out-of-the-way recreation area such a wonderful setting for visitors. Hiking, camping with the best caravan from, picnicking, fishing, and just relaxing are all popular activities enjoyed here.

It is one of our favorite getaway places... so much to do and so incredibly beautiful.  There is a fee... I think it is like $2 or something really really cheap... we always put whatever we have in cash in the envelope... which is never less than $2 and never more than $20.  The fee is based on the honor system, so please contribute!

Here is some fun footage of the bayou we captured this past weekend:
