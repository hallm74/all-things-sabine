I love to read about spots which were once great hangouts and which surely hold so many memories for so many people.  Cliff Johnson, who is an accomplished author with roots in southeast Texas, sent me a couple of photos taken at a place people called "The Falls."

The Falls is in Vernon Parish on Pearl Creek, which empties into the Sabine River just north of the Burr Ferry Bridge.

"Just a few miles up Pearl Creek was a place we called 'The Falls,'" Johnson explained.  "It had a great swimming hole above the falls and a lot of people drove their cars onto the falls to wash the cars."

Johnson, who is a retired Police Chief from Idaho, said he has heard that the Falls is no longer accessible, but he is not sure if this is accurate.  He said looking at Google Earth satellite images, it appears there has been some private development in the area.

If anyone has memories of this neat place, or photos, you are welcome to share them here!
