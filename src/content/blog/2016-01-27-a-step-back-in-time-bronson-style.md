![From 1909 comes this postcard of Bronson, Texas.](@assets/images/ats-bronson2-1024x683.jpg)(https://allthingssabine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ats-bronson2.jpg) From 1909 comes this postcard of Bronson, Texas.

In Sabine County, Texas, nine miles west of Hemphill, there is a town named Bronson.  It was once a hopping area, in the glory days of logging.  Donna Owens Jones shared two postcards from Bronson in 1909.  Back in that time, Bronson was just getting kicked off in its heyday, and had reached a population of 1,000.

I optimized the postcards a bit, trying to gain as much detail as I could without having a reverse effect, and I enlarged portions of each image.  In the first postcard, I was about to make out some detail...  on the left side, there is a Hotel, and on the right, what appears to be Horton or Norton Restaurant, along with a Grocery (possibly Thompson Grocery).  One of the businesses appears to have signage with the word "French" but I am hardly certain of this.

Jones Pool Room, offering "Cold Drinks" and declaring "Hiawatha."  There is a "General Merchandise & Feed Stuff" store and what appears to state "Ollie Nerwood Groceries."  The "groceries" part I am fairly confident on, the "Ollie Nerwood," not so much.
