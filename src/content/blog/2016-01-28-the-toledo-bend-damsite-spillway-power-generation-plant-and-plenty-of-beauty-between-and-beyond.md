The Toledo Bend Project was created by the Legislatures of the States of Texas and Louisiana and includes the mammoth 186,000 acre lake, a more than 11,000 ft. long, 100 ft. tall rolled earthen dam, a managed spillway with 11 release gates, and a hydroelectricity generation plant capable of producing over 200 million kilowatt hours of electricity a year.

In the video that follows, the footage on the Texas side of Toledo Bend, where the power plant is located, was taken this past weekend.Â  Some of the footage at the spillway was taken this past weekend as well, while some at the spillway was taken about a month ago.
