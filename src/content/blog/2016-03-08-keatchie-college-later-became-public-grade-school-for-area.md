Photo kindly shared by Michael Speights.\[/caption\]

First, it was Keatchie Female College, located in northern DeSoto Parish, Louisiana.  The college opened in the mid-1800s and remained a college until 1912.  Some time soon after this, the primary college buildings were utilized as the public grade school for the area, educating students grades K-12.

Michael Speights, of Keatchie, shared these fantastic photos of the original Keatchie College schoolhouse.  The photo above is from the college days, early 1900s.  The photos immediately below show different views.

The next photo shows the schoolhouse when it was used as a grade school.  The date on the photo is 1922-23.  Speights made these identifications:  "The older man in the middle of the back row with the grayish hair, tie and big ears is my great grandfather," Speights explained.  "The lady immediately in front of and to his right in the dark weather and white shirt is my aunt, his daughter.  On the front row, very far right of the pic, kneeling, the second little girl is another aunt, also his daughter.  Rounding out the group that I can identify is the young boy on the far left, standing, sixth from left, light colored hair and also with big ears... That's my grandfather."

Speights goes on to explain, "My great grandfather was principal of the school.  My grandfather was later the principal of the school in Stonewall.  They were both named John Townes Mosely."
