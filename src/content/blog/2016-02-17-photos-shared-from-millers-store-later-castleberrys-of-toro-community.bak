Update to [Miller Store of Toro: If these walls could talk](https://allthingssabine.com/miller-store-of-toro-community-if-these-walls-could-talk/)

After reading the previous article on the Miller Store, aka Castleberry's, Janell Fitts Richards shared some great photos of the store (it was Castleberry's when Janell was young, and was operated by Mrs. Castleberry who was the daughter of previous owner Mr. Miller).

"My mom remembers this store from her youth (she was born in 1924)," Janell explained.  "It was Castleberry's when I was young.  I took my children there in the early 80s and it was a museum of all the old items that had been used in the store."

These photos are so great, and I know will be appreciated by many.  Thank you for sharing them with us, Janell!
