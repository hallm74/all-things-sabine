I rounded up a collection of photos of the Cane River bridge in the City of Natchitoches, Louisiana and in Natchitoches Parish.  Almost all the photos are from the Cammie G. Henry Collection, at the Northwestern State University Library.  I added dates to the photos where dates were available, and details where details were available.  Any input is welcome and appreciated on any of these photos.
