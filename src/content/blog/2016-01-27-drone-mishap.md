They might be boring to the general audience, or they might be fun.  I can't call it, but we figured we might as well give it a shot... We will post our drone mishaps here... at least the ones we catch on "film."  If not for cheap entertainment, then maybe at least for lessons to others flying drones on what not to do (that is, if we even know what we did wrong... because we had some mishaps where we have no idea what went wrong)

This mini-crash (itsy bitsy, barely a blip on the radar) was at the old Tom Sawyer Chapel... Lesson learned, never have liftoff when a canopy of trees is slightly above you.  The drone was fine... just lost a propeller or two.
