![Bridge today, as part of US Hwy. 190 system.  Not sure when the bridge was constructed... Looked a good bit online but did not find a date pinpointed.  Feel free to comment if you know more about this bridge.  NOTE:  We took this photo from the air this past December... The river was at flood stage at this time... So it may appear quite high in these photos because it is quite high.](@assets/images/image-3-1024x768.png) Bridge today, as part of US Hwy. 190 system. Not sure when the bridge was constructed...
