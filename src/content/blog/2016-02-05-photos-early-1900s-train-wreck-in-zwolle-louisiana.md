![Train wreck in Zwolle, Louisiana](@assets/images/train-wreck-on-logging-spur-from-zwolle-to-Blue-Lake165-1024x618.jpg) Train wreck in Zwolle, Louisiana

I don't know very much about this train wreck at all... only that it was in Zwolle, Louisiana most likely Kansas City Southern Railroad, in the early 1900s.  Was part of the Roy Procell Photo Collection we are scanning and preserving through the Sabine Parish Library.

The backs of the three photos note that this was a train wreck on logging spur from Zwolle, Louisiana to Blue Lake, Louisiana (both in North Sabine Parish).  Anyone with any details, or ideas, or just suggestions... please comment!
