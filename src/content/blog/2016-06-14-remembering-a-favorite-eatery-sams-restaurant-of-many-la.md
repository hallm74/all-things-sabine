[![sams015](@assets/images/sams015-1024x695.jpg) Ah, Sam's Restaurant!   Fond memories for so many :)  Makes me hungry just to think about their yummy steak dinners!

If you lived anywhere in Sabine Parish, Louisiana, chances are you remember Sam's Restaurant.  For a little over a decade, Sam's was the go-to place for people to eat and socialize in the town of Many and well beyond.

The restaurant was located on U. S. Hwy. 171 on the southern side of town, from 1990 through around 2001. Sam's was owned by Sammie Morales and Tom Robinson of Florien.  Morales had for many years managed Hodges Gardens and then later Toro Hills Restaurant.  Ms. Morales' son, Carlos, managed Sam's and recently shared these photographs and menus with All Things Sabine.

I'm expecting these memorabilia will bring back a lot of fond memories!  Comment away on your memories :)
