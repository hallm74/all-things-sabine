![Natchitoches, Louisiana from the air in the early 1920s](@assets/images/old-natchitoches-775x1024.jpg) Natchitoches, Louisiana from the air in the early 1920s\[/caption\]

This aerial photo, taken I believe in 1923, of downtown Natchitoches is quite remarkable.  We have tried to duplicate the shot today so we can show the difference... and will I presume eventually get the right angle... but so far have been unsuccessful and quite frustrated!  In the meantime, though, I am sharing the photo because it is so interesting.  I also zoomed in on each part of the photo... please know anyone is welcome to share if they have any ideas or suggestions about long gone or much changed structures or landmarks.
